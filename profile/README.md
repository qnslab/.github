## Quantum Nano Sensing (QNS) Lab

A github org to hold the [QNSLab](https://www.qnslab.com/) software.

We are an experimental physics group investigating light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. In particular, we engineer and study quantum spin systems in solid and molecular hosts, which we control and interrogate optically. We also explore applications of these quantum systems for precision nanoscale sensing and imaging.

The Quantum Nano Sensing (QNS) Lab is based in the Department of Physics at RMIT University, Melbourne.
